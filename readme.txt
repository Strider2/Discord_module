Discord 1.0

This module will let you place Discord server widget on your site. 

If you have installed my codeshare module all you have to do is import the update_strider.sql file

If not, please import the phpvms_strider and edit the DiscordData.class.php file on line 64 and change the 4 to a 1.


To use this, you will need to get the Discord Server ID by going to your server going to server settings, then going to Widget. There you will find a few items, you need the Server ID click on the copy button, and paste it into the correct field in the add Widget form
